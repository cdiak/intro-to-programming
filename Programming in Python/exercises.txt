1.1.2 Describe what happens if you omit the following in helloworld.py:
    a. import
    Two problems:
            "stdio" is not defined Pylance(reportUndefinedVariable) [Ln 1, Col 1]
            "stdio" is not defined Pylance(reportUndefinedVariable) [Ln 3, Col 1]
    Running we get this error:
            Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "/Users/cdiak/Downloads/introcs-1.0/chapter1/helloworld.py", line 1, in <module>
                stdio
            NameError: name 'stdio' is not defined
    b. stdio
    Two problems:
            "Expected module name Pylance [Ln 1 Col 8]
            "Expected expression Pylance [Ln 3 Col 1]
    Running we get:
          File "/Users/cdiak/Downloads/introcs-1.0/chapter1/helloworld.py", line 1
    import 
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    c. import stdio
        One problem: "stdio" is not defined Pylance (reportUndefinedVariable) [Ln 1, Col 1]
        Running we get:
         File "/Users/cdiak/Downloads/introcs-1.0/chapter1/helloworld.py", line 1, in <module>
    stdio.writeln("Hello, world!")
    ^^^^^
NameError: name 'stdio' is not defined

1.1.3 Describe what happens if you misspell (by, say, omitting the second letter) the following in helloworld.py:

a. import
    Problems: 
        Statements must be separated by newlines or semicolons.
        iport is not defined [Ln 1, Col 1]
        stdio is not defined [Ln 1, Col 7] and [Ln 3, Col 1] 
    Runtime:
        SyntaxError on stdio

b. stdio
    Problems:
        Import "sdio" could not be resolved Pylance (reportMissingImports)
    Runtime:
        ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sdio'
c. write
    No detected problems in VS Code
    Runtime:
        AttributeError: module 'stdio' has no attribute 'witeln'. Did you mean: 'writeln'?
d. writeln
    Same here, no detected problem.
    Runtime:
        AttributeError: module 'stdio' has no attribute 'wite'. Did you mean: 'write'?

1.1.4 Describe what happens if you omit the following in helloworld.py:
a. the first '
    Problems:
        1. "(" was not closed
        2. "Hello" is not defined
        3. "World" is not defined
    Runtime:
        SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 3)
b. the second '
    Problems:
        1. "(" was not closed
        2. String literal is unterminated
    Runtime:
        SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 3)
c. the stdio.writeln() statement
    Program runs, but there is no output. It simply imports stdio.

1.1.5 Describe what happens if you try to execute useargument.py with each of the following command lines:

python useargument.py python
    Hi, python. How are you?
python useargument.py @!&^%
    zsh: event not found: &
python useargument.py 1234
    Hi, 1234. How are you?
python useargument Bob
    python: can't open file '/Users/.../useargument': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
useargument.py Bob
    zsh: command not found: useargument.py
python useargument.py Alice Bob
    Hi, Alice. How are you?


1.2.1 Suppose that a and b are integers.
What does the following sequences of statements do?
t = a 
b = t 
a = b

|Statement|a|b|t|
|---------|-|-|-|
|(initial)|2|4|-|
|t = a    |2|4|2|
|b = t    |2|2|2|
|a = b    |2|2|2|

This sequence of statements attempts to switch
the values of A and B but in fact assigns the
value of a to both a and b.

1.2.3 Suppose that a and b are booleans. Show that the expression

(not (a and b) and (a or b)) or ((a and b) or not (a or b))

Evaluates to true.

Truth table:

|  a  |  b  |  a and b  |  a or b  |  not (a and b)  |  (not (a and b) and (a or b))  |  (a and b) or not (a or b)  |  Final Expression  |
|:---:|:---:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:------------------:|
|  T  |  T  |     T     |    T     |        F        |               F                |             T              |          T         |
|  T  |  F  |     F     |    T     |        T        |               T                |             F              |          T         |
|  F  |  T  |     F     |    T     |        T        |               T                |             T              |          T         |
|  F  |  F  |     F     |    F     |        T        |               F                |             T              |          T         |

1.2.4: Suppose a and b are integers. Simplify the following expression:

(not (a < b) and not(a > b))

Answer:
a == b

1.2.5. What does each of these statements write? Explain each outcome.

stdio.writeln(2+3)  ==> 5 because it interprets
