1.2.1 Suppose that a and b are integers.
What does the following sequences of statements do?
t = a 
b = t 
a = b

|Statement|a|b|t|
|---------|-|-|-|
|(initial)|2|4|-|
|t = a    |2|4|2|
|b = t    |2|2|2|
|a = b    |2|2|2|

This sequence of statements attempts to switch
the values of A and B but in fact assigns the
value of a to both a and b.

1.2.3 Suppose that a and b are booleans. Show that the expression

(not (a and b) and (a or b)) or ((a and b) or not (a or b))

Evaluates to true.

Truth table:

|  a  |  b  |  a and b  |  a or b  |  not (a and b)  |  (not (a and b) and (a or b))  |  (a and b) or not (a or b)  |  Final Expression  |
|:---:|:---:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:------------------:|
|  T  |  T  |     T     |    T     |        F        |               F                |             T              |          T         |

|  F  |  T  |     F     |    T     |        T        |               T                |             T              |          T         |

1.2.4: Suppose a and b are integers. Simplify the following expression:

(not (a < b) and not(a > b))

Answer:
a == b

1.2.6. Explain how to use quadratic.py to find the square root of a number.
Quadratic finds the roots of the expression ax^2 + bx + c = 0 for a = 1.
If b = 0 that means x^2 + c = 0. This means that we can find the square root of 
c by choosing c' such that x^2 + (c'*-1) = 0, meaning x^2 = c'. Given that square
roots can only be positive, we take the positive valued output as the root.

1.2.13 Give the value of a after the execution of each of the following sequences:
a = 1       a = True    a = 2
a = a + a   a = not a   a = a*a 
a = a + a   a = not a   a = a*a 
a = a + a   a = not a   a = a*a 
Result: 6   False       256 

1.2.14 A physics student gets unexpected results when using the code:

force = G * mass1 * mass2 / radius * radius

to compute the values according to the formula F = Gm1m2/r^2

Explain the problem and correct the code.

Answer: Multiplication and division have the same precedence, and hence
are left associative in Python. Thus, parentheses are needed to correct
the code:

force = (G * mass1 * mass2) / (radius * radius)

1.2.15 Suppose that x and y are two floats that represent the Cartesian
coordinates of a point (x, y) in the plane. Given an expression that
evaluates to the distance of the point from the origin:

math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)
