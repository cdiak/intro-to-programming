Describe what happens if you misspell (by, say, omitting the second letter) the following in HelloWorld.java:

a. public
b. static
c. void
d. args

a. Syntax error on token "pblic", public expected
b. Syntax error on token "satic", static expected
c. vid cannot be resolved to a type. This is because the compiler is trying to interpret `vid` as a type but it isn't defined in the code or standard libraries for Java.
d. Still works. I learned that this is because the program still compiles and runs because args is just a name for the parameter in the main method, and the name of the parameter can be any valid identifier. In Java, parameter names do not affect the behavior or structure of the method; they are simply placeholders used within the method body.
