Some thoughts on my third time starting this book over. It does feel more intuitive this time, and I'm enjoying supplementing this with other lectures and things that I'm finding online. It's humbling working on these programs and realizing just how much about computers and computation that I don't know.

I'm also realizing how important mentorship is and the fact that programming is as much about
knowing what to focus on as what should be left out.

Update: I'm in D.C. this weekend and didn't have much time to code today, but I am here reflecting
on the progress that I've made as I had a very insightful conversation tonight with a couple engineers, one of whom is a mechanical and the other a biomedical engineer.
