Suppose that a and b are int variables.

Simplify the following expression:
```java
(!(a<b)&&!(a>b))
```

Sound it out: It's not the case that a is less than b and it is not the case that a is greater than b.

Therefore, a==b.

Chat tells me:

Your reasoning is spot on! Let’s simplify and explain it step by step:

Expression:

(!(a < b) && !(a > b))

Logical Sounding-Out:

	•	“It’s not the case that a is less than b” means a is not less than b.
	•	“It’s not the case that a is greater than b” means a is not greater than b.

For both statements to be true simultaneously, the only possibility is that:

a == b

Logical Simplification:

Using De Morgan’s laws and the properties of boolean algebra:
	1.	Expand the original expression:
!(a < b) && !(a > b)
	2.	Apply De Morgan’s law to each part:
	•	!(a < b) means a >= b.
	•	!(a > b) means a <= b.
	3.	Combine the two conditions:
a >= b && a <= b
	4.	Simplify further:
If a is both greater than or equal to b and less than or equal to b, the only possibility is:

a == b



Final Result:

The simplified expression is:

a == b

Intuition:

You correctly verbalized it: “It’s not the case that a is less than b and it’s not the case that a is greater than b” means a must equal b.
