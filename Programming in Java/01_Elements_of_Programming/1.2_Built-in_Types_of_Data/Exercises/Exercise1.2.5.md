The exclusive or (XOR) operator ^ for boolean operands is defined to b true if they are different,
false if they are the same. Give a truth table for this function

| a | b | a ^ b |
| T | T | F     |
| T | F | T     |
| F | T | T     |
| F | F | F     |

Your truth table for the XOR operator is correct. Here’s a clear presentation for clarity:

a	b	a ^ b
T	T	F
T	F	T
F	T	T
F	F	F

Explanation:

	•	XOR (^) evaluates to true if the two operands are different.
	•	XOR evaluates to false if the two operands are the same.

Breakdown:

	1.	When a and b are both true (T ^ T), the result is false because they are the same.
	2.	When a is true and b is false (T ^ F), the result is true because they are different.
	3.	When a is false and b is true (F ^ T), the result is true because they are different.
	4.	When a and b are both false (F ^ F), the result is false because they are the same.

The truth table perfectly captures these properties!
