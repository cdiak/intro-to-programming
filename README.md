# Intro to Programming

Welcome to my **Intro to Programming** repository! This is a code portfolio documenting my self-directed learning in programming, covering multiple languages, paradigms, and frameworks. 

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
- **A Learning Journal**: A structured collection of notes, exercises, and projects as I progress through courses and resources.
- **A Code Portfolio**: Demonstrating my growing skills in programming across various topics and languages.
- **A Reference Guide**: Providing well-organized and reusable examples for future projects or study.

## Current Structure

Here’s the structure of the repository and the topics it covers:

### Highlights

1. **Programming in Java and Python**:
   - Following Sedgewick and Wayne's curriculum.
   - Organized by chapter, with subfolders for exercises, code, and notes.

2. **SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)**:
   - Each chapter is divided into sections and sub-sections.
   - Includes:
     - `Code`: Implementations of exercises and examples.
     - `Exercises`: Solutions to practice problems.
     - `Notes`: Detailed write-ups of key concepts.

## Current Focus and Progress

| Topic                      | Resource                         | Status      |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Java**                   | Sedgewick and Wayne              | In Progress |
| **Python**                 | Sedgewick and Wayne              | In Progress |
| **LISP (SICP)**            | Structure and Interpretation     | In Progress |

## Tools and Technologies

This repository showcases work in the following languages and tools:
- **Languages**: Java, Python, LISP (Scheme)
- **Programming Paradigms**: Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional Programming
- **Concepts**: Algorithms, Data Structures, OOP, Recursion, Scientific Computation, and more.

## Goals

### Short-Term
- Complete exercises and projects for **Sedgewick and Wayne** and **SICP**.
- Deepen understanding of algorithms, data structures, and functional programming.

### Long-Term
- Expand the repository to include additional languages (e.g., C, JavaScript).
- Explore frameworks (e.g., Flask, Spring Boot).
- Develop larger real-world projects demonstrating learned skills.

## How to Use This Repository

If you’re also learning to program:
- Navigate to the appropriate directory (e.g., `SICP/` or `Programming in Java/`) to explore exercises, notes, and code.
- Use the `create_sicp_structure.sh` script as a template for setting up your own study folders.
- Check the `Notes/` subfolders for written summaries of key topics.
