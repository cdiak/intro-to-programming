## Race Condition

- A **Race Condition** occurs in concurrent computing when two or more processes or threads access shared resources or data and their execution order affects the outcome. It leads to unpredictable behavior, bugs, or system crashes because the final state depends on the timing and sequence of events.

### Key Idea:
- **Race Conditions** happen when the correctness of a program depends on the timing or order of execution of threads or processes. When multiple threads or processes access and modify shared data concurrently without proper synchronization, the final outcome can be inconsistent and unexpected.

### Causes of Race Conditions:

1. **Concurrent Access**:
   - When multiple processes or threads access and modify shared resources simultaneously without proper synchronization mechanisms.

2. **Lack of Synchronization**:
   - Absence of mechanisms like mutexes, locks, or semaphores to ensure that only one thread or process can access critical sections of code or data at a time.

3. **Timing Issues**:
   - Variations in timing and scheduling can lead to race conditions, where the order of execution affects the outcome.

### Examples:

1. **Bank Account Withdrawal**:
   - If two threads attempt to withdraw money from a bank account simultaneously without proper synchronization, both might see the same balance and withdraw more than available, leading to an overdrawn account.

   ```java
   // Example code prone to race condition
   int balance = 100;
   void withdraw(int amount) {
       if (balance >= amount) {
           balance -= amount;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Increment Operation**:
   - Multiple threads incrementing a shared counter variable without synchronization can result in incorrect counts.

   ```java
   // Example code prone to race condition
   int counter = 0;
   void increment() {
       counter++;
   }
   ```

### Prevention and Mitigation:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**:
   - Use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, locks, or critical sections to ensure that only one process or thread accesses the shared resource at a time.

2. **Atomic Operations**:
   - Use atomic operations or data types that ensure operations are completed as a single, indivisible unit to prevent race conditions.

3. **Synchronization Primitives**:
   - Implement synchronization primitives such as semaphores, condition variables, or monitors to coordinate access to shared resources.

4. **Thread-safe Data Structures**:
   - Utilize thread-safe or concurrent data structures provided by the language or libraries, which handle synchronization internally.

5. **Avoiding Shared State**:
   - Design systems to minimize or eliminate the use of shared state where possible. Use immutable objects or functional programming techniques to avoid state changes.

### Real-World Analogy:

- **Race Condition** can be likened to a **bidding war** where multiple buyers simultaneously place bids on the same item. If the auction system does not properly handle the timing of bids, it may result in multiple buyers winning the auction or other unexpected outcomes.

### Related Concepts:

- [[Mutex]]: A synchronization primitive that ensures mutual exclusion by allowing only one thread to access a critical section at a time.
- [[Lock]]: A mechanism to manage access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.
- [[Atomic Operation]]: An operation that is completed as a single, indivisible unit to avoid race conditions.
- [[Critical Section]]: A portion of code that must be executed by only one thread or process at a time to ensure correct behavior.

**Race Conditions** are critical issues in concurrent programming and must be carefully managed to ensure that software operates correctly and reliably. Proper synchronization and careful design are key to avoiding race conditions and ensuring predictable behavior.
