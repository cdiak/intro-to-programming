> **Exercise 1.15:** The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sinx≈x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin(x) = 3 \sin^3(x) - 4 \sin^3(x)
$$

> to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:
> 
``` scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
    (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
        angle
        (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

>    
>    For each iteration, the argument is divided by 3. This means the recursion reduces the size of exponentially. The inverse of an exponential function is a logarithm, so the order of growth is proportional to the logarithm of . Therefore, both the space and time complexity of this process are O(log(a)).
