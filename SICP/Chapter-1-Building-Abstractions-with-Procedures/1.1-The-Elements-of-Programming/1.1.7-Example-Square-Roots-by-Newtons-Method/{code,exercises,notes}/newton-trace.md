### Notes:
1. **Square of Guess**: Calculated as the square of the current guess.
2. **Absolute Difference**: `|guessÂ² - 72|`, representing how far the square of the guess is from the target value.
3. **Next Guess (Improved)**: Calculated using the formula `(guess + (72 / guess)) / 2`.

At iteration 7, the difference is less than 0.001, so the process stops, and the square root of 72 is approximated as **8.4859969**.
